# SkillCraft Technology - Data Science Internship: Task 2
This repository contains the work for the second task of the SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship.

📝 Project Description
The goal of this task was to perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a passenger dataset. 
We creating visualizations such as pie chart, a heatmap, and a histogram using Python's matplotlib and seaborn to to understand passenger demographics, attribute correlations, and data distributions.

📊 Visualizations
Here are the charts generated from the analysis:

1. Gender Distribution of Passengers
(A pie chart showing that the passengers were approximately 64.4% male and 35.6% female)

2. Correlation Heatmap
(A heatmap visualizing the correlation between numerical features such as Pclass, Age, Fare, etc.)

3. Age Distribution of Passengers
(A histogram showing the frequency distribution of passenger ages, with a peak for passengers in their late 20s and early 30s)
